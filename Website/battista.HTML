					<h2>Pininfirana Battista</h2><br><br>
					<p>The Pininfarina Battista is an electric sports car manufactured by Italian automobile manufacturer Automobili Pininfarina. The name Battista is a tribute to <br> Pininfarina's founder Battista Farina. The car was publicly unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. The Battista is powered by a 120 kWh battery pack supplied by Rimac Automobili. The car has four individual motors placed at each wheel and they have a combined power output of 1,400 kW (1,903 PS; 1,877 hp) and 2,300 Nm (1,696 lbft) of torque. The Battista shares 40-50% of the pure technical components of the Rimac C Two.<br><br>

The car has a carbon-fibre monocoque chassis with aluminium crash absorbers at the front and the rear and most of the body panels are also built from the <br> same material in order to keep the weight low. The car has 21 inch wheels wrapped in Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres. <br><br>

The adjustable suspension system of the car will be tuned for maximum road comfort. The car has five driving modes all of whom alter the power generated by <br> the powertrain. The car features carbon ceramic brake discs measuring 390 mm (15 in) at the front and rear and equipped with six piston calipers front and aft. <br>The active rear wing acts as an airbrake to improve stopping power.<br><br>

The interior of the car is customisable according the customer's specification. A carbon steering wheel is flanked by two large screens on either side, displaying <br> vital data to the driver. The interior is upholstered in leather. The car is claimed by the manufacturer to generate cabin driving sound using acoustics.<br><br></div>
