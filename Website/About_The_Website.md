In this website I have used HTML, CSS and some bootstrap UI. The website has a webpage named Image Gallery(named ky.html) which is responsive. 
Whenever browser size is changed the effect is shown. Also, I have used hover text over the images in that webpage. 
A navigation bar has also been created. You can see hover and active effects in it. 
I have also put an icon for the website that will appear at the top of the browser tab where title is given.
JavaScript has been used for the preloader.
The homepage is index.html.
