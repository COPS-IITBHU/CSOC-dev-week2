# CSOC-dev-week2
The repository for CSOC dev week 2 submissions.

## Introduction
This week we shall focus on web development basics. Web development is a basic skill which often is said as a good start to the development field. This week you have to make a simple (or complex :)) web page using HTML and CSS. You also need to use Bootstrap to make the UI. Please note that we won't allow any external readymade templates (we can easily recognize :)). THe evaluation would be done mainly on the basis of UI/UX, responsiveness and authenticity of the code.

Make sure that you make a seperate folder for your site and not put the files directly in the home folder.
